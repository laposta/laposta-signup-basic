== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The changes I made to my lists are not being shown on my website. What should I do?  =

Please login to your admin dashboard and go to "Settings" -> "Laposta Signup Basic" and click on the button with the text "Reset Cache"

= How do I enable logging of errors for debugging?  =

* By default, the logger in our plugin follows the setting of `WP_DEBUG`: if `WP_DEBUG` is enabled (true), logging is active.
* To override this default behavior, you can use the filter 'laposta_signup_basic_enable_logging'.
* When logging is enabled, messages are recorded using the PHP `error_log` function. To view these logs, you have three options:
    - **Server Log File**: Typically, you can find the error log in your server's PHP log file. Its location varies depending on your hosting environment.
    - **When `WP_DEBUG_LOG` is Enabled**: If `WP_DEBUG_LOG` is set to true, WordPress logs errors to a `debug.log` file inside the `wp-content` directory. You can access this file via FTP or your hosting file manager.
    - **Using a Plugin**: Plugins like 'Debug' can help you view log messages directly within the WordPress admin area.
    - **Note**: Check your hosting provider's documentation or contact their support for more details on locating and accessing log files.

= 2.0.1 =
Please note, this is a major update and may not be 100% backwards compatible with previous versions.

Key changes:
* Instant Feedback: Forms are now submitted using AJAX, providing immediate feedback on errors or success directly within the user's current view. This enhances user experience by eliminating page reloads and keeping important feedback prominently visible.
* Error container placement: The error container is therefore placed above the submit button. This change enhances error visibility.
* Conditional custom class loading: Before, some custom classes were always loaded and some were only loaded if the chosen styling was set to 'custom'. Now all classes are loaded based on the selection in the admin UI. This update aims to improve the consistency of the admin UI.

Impact on Your Site:
* If you have custom styling or scripts that depend on the old error container placement, you may need to adjust them.
* Customizations relying on the custom classes should be reviewed to ensure compatibility.
